## Concepts

* Cashflows(money coming to you or away from you) and Assets
```
Asset_t = {CF_t1, CF_t+1, CF_t+2, ... } # t means at some timepoint
```
* The Present Value
```
net_present_value = CF0 + exchange_rate1*CF1 + exchange_rate2*CF2 + ...
$1 in Year 0 = $1 * (1 + r)^T in Year T # it turns out that the market gonna give us many diffrent "r"s
```
* The Perpetuity
```
PV = C/r
```
* The Annuity
```
PV = C/r - (C/r) / (1+r)^T # works for mortgage valuation too
```
* Compounding
* Inflation
```
the purchasing power of your money can vary overtime
real_wealth = (1+r_nominal)/(1+Ï€) - 1
```
* APR
```
annual percentage rate
```
* EAR
```
equivalent annual rate # you should actually care about
EAR = (1 + APR/T)^T - 1
```
